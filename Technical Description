There are many forms of fractures. As a general rule, they collapse after running out of energy, only taking as much as the caster allows. However, the exception is fractures made with a sacrificeâ€”these are multiple times more potent. Fractures made this way are far larger and more powerful, absorbing the energy of anything that passes between them. They will continue to grow in size until both sides of the Fracture have merged or until they encounter enough energy. Only then will they finally disperse, leaving behind a small bundle of energy. Only the strongest individuals of each race can create portals of this sort.


Humanity is the only current force capable of creating a liquid called bile, made by treating the blood of sylvans. Bile is used in the process of creating mirrored races. When Bile is administered to living organisms, the temporal anomalies of the liquid cause the organism to undergo a mutation, becoming a new race. This process is irreversible, and the new race is unable to return to their original form. in exchange however, the new race is able to use the material 5 fractural abilities, and are able to make the transition between worlds.

Eldritch races on the other hand, are those that come from a an ever changing and chaotic dimension that not much is known about. They each have abilities that allow them to manipulate some aspect of their area, and have acess to the 5 eldritch fractural abilities. 


Each Fracture magical race can learn up to 3 magic types, however they only start with 1. Mirrored races, will always start with a material magic type. Eldritch races, will always start with an eldritch magic type. Later in life, they can learn other magic types
