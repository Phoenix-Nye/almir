#Magic Explanation
Magic in this world functions through the manipulation of "Potential" - a malleable 
energy that all characters can generate and control. Think of Potential as raw 
magical clay that can be:

1. Generated by the user
2. Shaped while in physical contact
3. Imbued with elemental or eldritch properties
4. Given direction and momentum

Once shaped, Potential can be activated from a distance, though any further 
reshaping still requires physical contact. This allows for complex trigger 
mechanisms and delayed effects.

For example:
- A fire mage might shape Potential into a spear, imbue it with fire, then launch it
- A spatial mage could form Potential into a disk and imbue it with teleportation properties
- A bio mage might coat their hands in Potential to enhance healing abilities

The key limitations are:
- Must maintain contact while shaping
- Can only imbue with known magical properties
- Effects end when Potential disperses or is activated
