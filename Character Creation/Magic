#Magic Explanation
Magic in this world functions through the manipulation of "Potential" - a malleable 
energy that all characters can generate and control. Think of Potential as raw 
magical clay that can be:

1. Generated by the user
2. Shaped while in physical contact
3. Imbued with elemental or abstract magical properties
4. Given direction and momentum

Once shaped, Potential can be activated from a distance, though any further 
reshaping still requires physical contact. This allows for complex trigger 
mechanisms and delayed effects.

For example:
- A fire mage might shape Potential into a spear, imbue it with fire, then launch it
- A spatial mage could form Potential into a disk and imbue it with teleportation properties
- A bio mage might coat their hands in Potential to poison their target's

The key limitations are:
- Must maintain contact while shaping
- Can only imbue with known magical properties
- Effects end when Potential disperses or is activated

CAUTION: Entropy magic is inherently unstable. Improperly shaped Potential can cause 
objects to shift into alternate forms - a sword might become a different version of 
itself forged in another reality, or a door might transform into one that opens 
somewhere else entirely. These "reality bleeds" are temporary but unpredictable.

Examples of Uncontrolled Effects:
- Metal aging centuries in moments
- Plants evolving into unknown species
- Objects merging with alternate versions
- Living things experiencing multiple possible fates simultaneously

Proper entropy magic focuses on controlling and directing these natural forces 
rather than fighting against them. Masters of this art understand that decay and 
renewal are two sides of the same coin.
