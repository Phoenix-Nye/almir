Old Earth City Denizens
═══════════════════════════

RUIN MATRIARCH
-------------
Population:    Solitary (1 per ruined city)
Threat Level: Scarlet [EXTREME]
Size:         20-25 ft leg span, body mass comparable to a small house

DESCRIPTION
══════════
These colossal arachnids are the apex predators of abandoned urban zones, making 
their lairs in the deepest subterranean levels of fallen skyscrapers. Their 
chitinous shells have fused with scavenged urban debris, creating a natural armor 
of steel and concrete. Ancient and intelligent, they coordinate lesser spiders in 
their territory through complex vibration patterns in their vast web networks.

ABILITIES
═════════
• Architectural Integration: Can utilize their webs to manipulate building structures
• Psychic Dominion: Controls all smaller spiders within their territory
• Structural Web: Creates reinforced webs that can support massive weight
• Debris Projection: Can launch crystallized web balls containing rubble
• Tremorsense: Can detect movement anywhere in their web network

COMBAT NOTES
════════════
Extremely intelligent and patient hunters. Will collapse entire buildings to trap 
prey. Never fights alone - always surrounded by swarms of lesser spiders. Their 
lair will be a maze of steel-reinforced webbing and deliberately weakened 
structural points.

HARVESTED MATERIALS
══════════════════
• Matriarch Chitin (Nearly indestructible building material) [§§§§]
• Command Gland (Priceless to beast tamers) [§§§§§][**]
• Reinforced Silk (Superior to standard spider silk) [§§]

NOTES
═════
Humanity's fall precedes the earliest recorded encounter with a Ruin Matriarch. Their lairs often contain 
perfectly preserved artifacts from the collapse, wrapped carefully in protective 
webbing.

STEEL SENTINEL SPIDER
--------------------
Population:    20-30 per Matriarch
Threat Level: ORANGE [Medium]
Size:         8-10 ft leg span

DESCRIPTION
══════════
Born of the Matriarch's influence, these specialized arachnids serve as the 
elite guard within her domain. Their bodies have naturally incorporated steel 
and concrete fragments, forming makeshift armor plates that mirror the 
architecture around them. Unlike their queen, these fragments are loosely 
attached, allowing for swift and aggressive movement.

ABILITIES
═════════
• Urban Camouflage: Can blend perfectly with ruined architecture
• Coordinated Hunting: Share tactical information through web vibrations
• Armor Plating: Natural defense enhanced by incorporated building materials
• Web Rappelling: Can quickly deploy from any height using reinforced silk
• Structure Sense: Can detect structural weaknesses in buildings

COMBAT NOTES
════════════
Hunt in organized squads of 3-5. Will use building architecture to their 
advantage, often herding prey into prepared kill zones. Can quickly respond 
to any intrusion within their Matriarch's territory. Unlike most spiders, 
these will actively pursue threats.

HARVESTED MATERIALS
══════════════════
• Composite Chitin (Valuable armor material) [§§]
• Adrenaline Glands (Used in combat stimulants) [§§§][**]
• Reinforced Silk (Superior to standard spider silk) [§§]

NOTES
═════
These creatures show remarkable problem-solving abilities and will remember 
failed tactics, adapting their strategies for future encounters. They're often 
seen maintaining and repairing structural supports within their territory.

SILK WEAVER SPIDER
------------------
Population:    100-200 per Matriarch
Threat Level: YELLOW [LOW]
Size:         3-4 ft leg span

DESCRIPTION
══════════
The smallest of the Matriarch's children, these industrious arachnids maintain 
the vast web networks throughout their queen's domain. Their bodies are adorned 
with patches of salvaged building materials, though far less extensively than 
their larger kin. Multiple specialized spinnerets allow them to produce varying 
types of silk for different architectural purposes.

ABILITIES
═════════
• Multi-thread Weaving: Can produce and manipulate multiple silk strands simultaneously
• Structural Analysis: Instinctively identifies and repairs structural weaknesses
• Swarm Coordination: Can rapidly organize into living bridges and ladders
• Chemical Signaling: Marks safe passages through web networks for larger kin

COMBAT NOTES
════════════
While not primary combatants, they will swarm threats in overwhelming numbers if 
cornered. Their true danger lies in their ability to rapidly alter terrain and 
alert stronger defenders. Often retreat to pre-prepared silk tunnels when threatened.

HARVESTED MATERIALS
══════════════════
• Silk Sacs (Valued by textile crafters) [§§][*]
• Construction Silk (Industrial-grade webbing) [§]

NOTES
═════
These creatures display remarkable architectural intelligence, often incorporating 
human building techniques into their web structures. They've been observed 
teaching these methods to younger specimens.

AFFLICTED HUMAN
-----------------
Population:    10-100 per settlement
Threat Level: YELLOW [LOW]
Size:         Human-sized, often emaciated

DESCRIPTION
══════════
Victims of the Malignant Bloom, these shambling humans bear distinctive 
violet-veined skin and glazed, opalescent eyes. Small entropy crystals often 
protrude from their joints and spine, creating an unsettling chiming sound as 
they move. Their bodies exist in a state of accelerated decay, yet are 
paradoxically preserved by the aberrant entropy magic that corrupted them.

ABILITIES
═════════
• Pain Suppression: Feel no pain or fatigue
• Hive Instinct: Unconsciously coordinate with nearby Afflicted creatures
• Entropy Growth: Slowly accumulate reality-warping crystals in their flesh

COMBAT NOTES
════════════
Individually weak and uncoordinated, but dangerous in numbers. Their entropy 
crystals can shatter when struck, releasing bursts of uncontrolled decay magic. 
Avoid close combat if possible - their unstable entropy field can corrupt organic matter. 
They are drawn to sources of entropic energy, making them easy to predict and redirect.

HARVESTED MATERIALS
══════════════════
• Aberrant Crystals (Used in containment research) [§§][**]
• Preserved Tissue (Valuable to scholars) [§][*]

NOTES
═════
Unfortunate humans who were exposed to the Malignant Bloom's entropy-warped spores. 
While technically still alive, they exist in a dream-like state, seemingly aware of 
decay patterns that normal humans cannot perceive. Eventually, the entropy crystals 
overwhelm their hosts entirely, transforming them into volatile crystalline statues 
that shatter at the slightest touch, releasing concentrated bursts of aberrant 
entropy magic.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

AFFLICTED HOUND
---------------
Population:    5-15 per pack
Threat Level: YELLOW [LOW]
Size:         Large dog to wolf-sized

DESCRIPTION
══════════
Former domesticated dogs and feral strays corrupted by the Malignant Bloom. 
Their fur has fallen away, revealing skin laced with pulsing entropy crystals 
that follow their muscle structure, creating an unsettling chiming sound as they move.
Unlike their human counterparts, they retain much of their hunting instincts,
making them far more dangerous.

ABILITIES
═════════
• Pack Tactics: Coordinate attacks with unnatural precision
• Accelerated Decay: Entropy formations develop faster than human afflicted
• Enhanced Scent: Can track targets and locate potential new hosts.

COMBAT NOTES
════════════
More aggressive than afflicted humans, they actively hunt for new hosts rather 
than merely wandering. They've been known to purposefully crash into nearby afflicted 
creatures or entropy formations to trigger decay chain reactions. The accelerated 
entropy growth makes them more volatile but shorter-lived than human afflicted.

HARVESTED MATERIALS
══════════════════
• Aberration Crystals (Used in containment research) [§§][**]
• Preserved Tissue (Valuable to scholars) [§][*]

NOTES
═════
These creatures represent a more aggressive strain of the entropy affliction, possibly 
due to their simpler nervous systems allowing faster crystal integration. They 
often serve as "hunting hounds" for larger groups of afflicted, tracking down 
potential new hosts. Their shortened lifespan of only 
a few weeks makes them particularly desperate and dangerous.

MALIGNANT BLOOM
---------------
Population:    Solitary
Threat Level: SCARLET [EXTREME]
Size:         20-30 ft diameter when fully bloomed

DESCRIPTION
══════════
A massive, otherworldly flower that exists in a state of perpetual decay and renewal, 
its roots piercing through reality itself. Its petals shimmer with impossible 
geometries, each one showing a different stage of growth and deterioration 
simultaneously. The crystalline core pulses with aberrant entropy magic, releasing 
spores that corrupt the natural cycle of living tissue. Reality itself seems to age 
and transform around its presence.

ABILITIES
═════════
• Entropy Spores: Releases reality-warping spores that corrupt organic matter
• Cycle Anchoring: Cannot be fully destroyed while connected to multiple timelines
• Temporal Distortion: Can shift between different states of its own decay
• Matter Corruption: Transforms nearby living tissue into crystallized entropy
• Decay Lure: Can attract masses of afflicted through timeline manipulation

COMBAT NOTES
════════════
Direct confrontation is suicide - the bloom's presence alone can begin 
crystallization in living tissue. It uses afflicted creatures as both shields
and ammunition, converting them into deadly crystal shards. The only known
method of containment is through specialized fracture magic barriers, though
it often simply relocates through the veil when threatened.

HARVESTED MATERIALS
══════════════════
• Violent Core (Coveted by eldritch scholars) [§§§§§][**]
• Floral Fragments (Used in fracture research) [§§§§]

NOTES
═════
The first Malignant Bloom appeared shortly after the great collapse, though 
whether it was caused by the fracturing remains debated. Its very existence seems 
to be an impossibility - a living creature that exists in all stages of its life 
cycle simultaneously. Some theorize it's not truly alive at all, but rather a 
manifestation of nature's attempt to restore balance through controlled decay.
