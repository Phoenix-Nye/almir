THE SHATTERED SANCTUARY
═══════════════════════════

LOCATION NAME: Shattered Sanctuary
DIFFICULTY: ORANGE [MEDIUM-HIGH]
RECOMMENDED LEVEL: Experienced Group (3-5 players)
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-3 sessions

HISTORICAL CONTEXT
-----------------
Once a thriving oasis settlement, this location was transformed during the great 
firestorms. The intense heat fused the surrounding sand into glass, while the 
underground water system created a network of steam-carved tunnels. The Almir 
Nomads later converted these tunnels into a permanent settlement, until a 
Mirror Serpent infestation forced them to abandon it.

CURRENT STATE
------------
The surface is a maze of glass spires and crystalline dunes, while below lies 
a vast network of tunnels. Mirror Serpents have claimed the deeper tunnels, 
while a small group of Steel Vultures nests in the higher spires. Recent 
tremors have destabilized parts of the tunnel system.

KEY LOCATIONS
------------
**Surface Level**
◆ The Glass Forest (Crystalline spires)
◆ Vulture's Perch (Abandoned watchtower)
◆ Shattered Plaza (Former marketplace)
◆ Wind-Carved Archways (Natural formations)

**Upper Tunnels**
◆ Nomad Living Quarters (Partially intact)
◆ Bioluminescent Gardens (Abandoned Glass Grazer pens)
◆ Storage Halls (Some supplies remain)
◆ Water Collection System (Still functional)

**Lower Tunnels**
◆ Mirror Serpent Nests
◆ Ancient Water Reservoir
◆ Crystal Formation Chambers
◆ Collapsed Temple Ruins

ACTIVE THREATS
-------------
• 2-3 Mirror Serpents (territorial)
• Pack of Steel Vultures (6-8)
• Unstable tunnel sections
• Glass dust storms (surface)

OBJECTIVES
---------
**Primary**
- Recover valuable resources from storage halls
- Map safe passages through tunnel network
- Document Mirror Serpent behavior

**Secondary**
- Find Almir artifacts
- Restore water collection system
- Discover reason for settlement abandonment

RESOURCES
---------
• Abandoned Nomad supplies
• Functional water system
• Glass Grazer moss gardens
• Steel Vulture nesting materials

SPECIAL NOTES
------------
- Surface visibility varies with glass storms
- Tunnel stability decreases with depth
- Mirror Serpents more active during night
- Upper tunnels contain breathable air pockets
- Lower tunnels require breathing apparatus
