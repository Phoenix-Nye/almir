ALMIR DESERT WASTELAND
═══════════════════════════

After the shattering, the veil containing these segments of Almir
drowned out all sunlight, and slowed rainfall killing off plant life. 
In newer days plant life has only just begun to grow again, thanks to the help of 
abberation magic usage becoming more widespread. These segments are now 
home to many different sorts of monsters, and the occassional traveler. 
Many of the monsters here are not native to the desert, whom were originally residents of 
old earth.
