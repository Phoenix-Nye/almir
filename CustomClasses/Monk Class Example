**10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.**

- 3rd

- 11th
- 17th

Each tradition defines a **combat axis** such as control, mobility, or burst damage.

---

## Ability Score Improvement (Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 19)
+2 to one ability score or +1 to two.

---

## Level 5 Power Spike: Extra Attack, Stunning Strike

### Extra Attack
You can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action.

### Stunning Strike
When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 Ki point to attempt to stun the target. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

---

## Level-by-Level Features (5–20)

### Ki-Empowered Strikes (Level 6)
Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion (Level 7)
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

### Stillness of Mind (Level 7)
You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Unarmored Movement Improvement (Level 9)
Your speed from Unarmored Movement increases (e.g. +10 feet at 6th level, further increases at 10th, 14th, and 18th per your table). *Design: mobility scaling keeps the monk’s skirmish identity.*

### Purity of Body (Level 10)
You are immune to disease.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Level 13)
You can understand and be understood by any creature that can understand a language.

### Diamond Soul (Level 14)
You gain proficiency in all saving throws. When you fail a saving throw, you can spend 1 Ki point to reroll it and must use the new result.

### Timeless Body (Level 15)
You suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you cannot be aged magically. You still need food and water.

### Empty Body (Level 18)
As an action, you can spend 4 Ki points to become invisible for 1 minute and gain resistance to all damage except force. You can end the effect early as a bonus action.

---

## Capstone: Perfect Self (Level 20)
When you roll initiative and have no Ki points remaining, you regain **4 Ki points**.

> **Design Intent:** Ensure the monk always begins an encounter functional.  
**Balance:** Reliable but not explosive; prevents “dead turn” scenarios with no infinite loops.
