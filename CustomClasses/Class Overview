## Core Feature: Potential Armament (Level 1)
> **Design Intent:** Defines the baseline gameplay loop: conjure a bonded weapon, choose element (damage type), fight. Weapon type is a fixed choice per character.

**Basic Element Selection**  
At 1st level you choose one basic element: **Fire**, **Water**, **Earth**, or **Air**. This choice is permanent.  
- **Fire** → Fire damage  
- **Water** → Cold damage  
- **Earth** → Bludgeoning damage  
- **Air** → Force damage  

**Weapon Conjuration**  
- **Action:** Bonus action to conjure.  
- **Bonded armament:** You have one fixed weapon type (e.g. longsword, spear) that you conjure; this choice is permanent.  
- **Stats:** Same as the physical weapon (damage die, properties, range).  
- **Attack/damage:** Use Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity.  
- **Damage type:** Determined by your chosen element (and at 6th level, by which element you choose when conjuring).  
- **Duration:** Until you dismiss it (free action) or you fall unconscious.  

**Second Element (Level 6)**  
At 6th level you learn a second element. Choose one: **Frequency** (Force), **Spatial** (Psychic), **Bio** (Acid), **Light** (Radiant). When you conjure your weapon, you choose which of your two elements to use for that weapon’s damage type.

---

## Minor Shape Manipulation (Level 1)
- **Effect:** Extend, compress, bend, or twist your conjured weapon within 5 feet.  
- **Use:** At will, but costs a full action.  
- **Applications:** Grab or move objects up to 5 lbs; open/close doors, latches, containers; trip or unbalance a creature (save or check, DM discretion); light or douse small flames (elementally flavored).

---

## Potential Points (Level 2)
- Start with **2** Potential Points at 2nd level.  
- **Maximum** = your Potentialist level.  
- **Short rest:** Regain some (amount TBD).  
- **Long rest:** Regain all.  
- Used to activate Potential Techniques and other special abilities.

## Modular Feature: Potential Techniques (Level 2+)
- Learn **2** techniques at 2nd level; +1 at 6th, 10th, 14th, 18th.  
- When you gain a level, you can replace one technique with another you could learn.  
- Some techniques may be restricted by subclass.  
- **Costs:** Typically 1–3 Potential Points per use.  
- **Categories:** Movement/Range, Battlefield Control, Defensive, Adaptive Strategies.  

> **Balance Target:** Comparable to Warlock Invocations or Battlemaster Maneuvers

---

## Subclass: Potential Path (Level 3)
Choose at 3rd level. Features at **3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th** level.  
- Path of the Blade | Path of the Shield | Path of the Bow | Path of the Hammer | Path of Fractured Reality  
*(Subclass features to be designed separately.)*

## Ability Score Improvement (Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 19)
+2 to one ability or +1 to two. Custom feats TBD.

## Extra Attack (Level 5)
When you take the Attack action, you can attack twice.

## Signature Form (Aspect) (Level 5)
Choose **one specific weapon type** (your bonded armament) and **one Aspect**. Both choices are permanent. Aspect is always active when wielding that weapon type.  
- **Aspect of Cleave:** Hit with Attack → deal half weapon damage (no modifier) to one other creature within 5 ft of target (once per attack).  
- **Aspect of Reach:** +5 ft reach with that weapon for attacks and opportunity attacks.  
- **Aspect of Piercing:** Ignore half and three-quarters cover with that weapon.  
- **Aspect of Hook:** On hit, pull or shove that creature 5 ft (no obviously deadly terrain).  
- **Aspect of Precision:** Once per turn on hit with that weapon, add proficiency bonus to damage.

## Scaling Features (Placeholders)
- **Level 9:** Improved Potential Control (point efficiency, both elements).  
- **Level 11:** Dual Armament (two weapons, different elements).  
- **Level 13:** Advanced Techniques.  
- **Level 17:** Master Potentialist (cost reduction, combine elements on one weapon).

---

## Capstone: Potential Mastery (Level 20)
- If you have 0 Potential Points when you roll initiative, regain 4.  
- Conjured weapons gain +2 to attack and damage rolls.  
- Can maintain up to 3 different weapons.  
- Techniques cost 1 less Potential Point (minimum 1).  

**Balance:** Equivalent to a permanent 9th-level spell-lite effect; avoid infinite resource loops.
